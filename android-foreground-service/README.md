Foreground service integration for HRM Chat (Android)

This folder contains a ready-to-drop set of files and instructions to add a native foreground service
to the Android app generated by Capacitor. The service keeps a persistent notification and can
maintain sockets or background work when the app is backgrounded (not recommended when the app
is force-quit by the user).

Files:
- `ForegroundService.kt` — Kotlin service implementation
- `manifest-snippet.xml` — XML snippet to merge into `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- `MainActivity-snippet.kt` — Kotlin snippet showing where to start/stop the service in `MainActivity`

Integration steps (apply in your Android project `android/app/src/main`):

1. Copy `ForegroundService.kt` into your app package directory, e.g.:
   `android/app/src/main/java/com/example/hrmchat/ForegroundService.kt`

2. Merge `manifest-snippet.xml` into `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` inside the `<application>` element.

3. Update your `MainActivity` (if using Kotlin) to call `ForegroundService.startService(this)` in `onStop()` and
   `ForegroundService.stopService(this)` in `onStart()` to start the foreground service when the app is backgrounded
   and stop it when the app returns to foreground. See `MainActivity-snippet.kt`.

4. Ensure your app creates a NotificationChannel (the snippet does this) and that you have an app icon resource
   `mipmap/ic_notification` (or change the code to use an existing drawable).

5. Rebuild the Android project (via Android Studio or CI). The service will run as a foreground service and keep
   a persistent notification while active.

Notes & considerations
- Foreground services consume battery and should be used sparingly. For messaging apps, prefer FCM push notifications
  for message delivery while the app is not in the foreground. Use a foreground service only if you need real-time socket
  connectivity while the app is backgrounded.
- If the user force-stops the app from system settings, the system prevents background services from restarting until
  the user explicitly opens the app again.
